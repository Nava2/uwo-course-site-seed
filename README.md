# UWO Course Site Seed

This project builds a static page using Gulp, and Pug that allows content creation for a simple
course website that has Labs and Lectures. 

## Lectures

Lectures are built using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js). There are specialized
pug filters/mixins available. 

## Labs

Labs generated via the main index page. Building the labs utilize multiple blocks to quickly make 
labs of a designated format. 

## Example

See the currently in use site: [SE2205B - Data Structures and Algorithms - Winter 2017](https://uwoece-se2205b-2017.github.io).
